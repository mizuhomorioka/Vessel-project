# vessel-project
## about this project
this is a repository for my second project of [the Lede program 2023](https://ledeprogram.com/).
I'd like to create a chart of energy security after listened to a Columbia University class that Japan is vulnerable to a maritime blockade. In particular, I learned that oil tankers pass through hot spots in the South China Sea.
## Data Source
basically, I manually extracted data about the location of vessels from [MarineTraffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-151.5/centery:57.4/zoom:2), a website tracking the GPS of vessels all over the world.
## Things improvesd
- This time I used new tools to visualize, such as flourish, Adobe Illustrator, ai2html.
- Organized CSS better than the first one
## Issues
- I tried to use scraping or API to get the data from MarineTraffic, but I couldn't find relevant section when scraping, and API required me to pay. I will practice scraping or API next time.
