# vessel-project
## about this project
this is a repository for my second project of [the Lede program 2023](https://ledeprogram.com/).
I'd like to create a chart of energy security after listened to a Columbia University class that Japan is vulnerable to a maritime blockade. In particular, I learned that oil tankers pass through hot spots in the South China Sea.
## Data Source
I scraped [MarineTraffic](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/home/centerx:-151.5/centery:57.4/zoom:2), a website tracking the GPS of vessels all over the world.I also filtered by the ship type, and manually extracted the data.
## Things improvesd
- This time I used new tools to visualize, such as flourish, Adobe Illustrator, ai2html.
- Organized CSS better than the first one
- scraping
## Issues
- Although I did scraping, I couldn't do the whole because of the amount, so the data is not perfect.
